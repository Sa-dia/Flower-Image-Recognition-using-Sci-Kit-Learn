# 🌸 Flower Image Classification using Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates a simple **flower image classification** system using **Scikit-Learn** and machine learning techniques.  
The model is trained to classify flowers into different categories based on their images.

## 📝 Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Build a machine learning model to classify flower images into different species.

**Dataset:**  
- The dataset contains images of flowers (e.g., roses, tulips, sunflowers, etc.).  
- Images are preprocessed and converted to feature vectors suitable for training with Scikit-Learn.  

**Techniques Used:**  
- Feature extraction from images  
- Train/Test split for model evaluation  
- Classifiers: `SVM`  
- Model evaluation using accuracy score, confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `opencv-python` / `Pillow` (for image preprocessing)
